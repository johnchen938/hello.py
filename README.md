🎮 Mini Games Collection 🎮

🚀 Welcome to the Most Awesome, Unnecessary, Yet Totally Fun Mini-Game Collection! 🎉

🤔 What is this?

This is a collection of tiny, completely useless yet highly entertaining games. You will laugh, you will cry, you will rage quit. But most importantly, you will waste time like a pro. 💯

🎮 What Games Can You Play?

✔ Guess the Number – Try to guess a secret number between 1-10. Sounds easy? Well… we’ll see. 😏
✔ Rock, Paper, Scissors – Challenge an AI that is 100% not cheating (probably).
✔ Word Scramble – Can you unscramble words faster than a chicken pecking at a keyboard? 🐔
✔ Dice Roller – Roll a dice. That’s it. No deeper meaning. 🎲
✔ Math Quiz – Because everyone loves doing math for fun… right? RIGHT?! 🤓
✔ Hangman – Guess the word before the stick figure meets a tragic end. 😱
